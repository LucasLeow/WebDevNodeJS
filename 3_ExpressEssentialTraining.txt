-- Introduction to ExpressJS --

	- App framework for Node.js
	- allow front-end engineers to handle APIs + backend functionalities of web app
	- front-end (client-side) JS involves JS Browser (query)
	- back-end (server-side) JS will involve backend functions
		- JS packages (npm)
		- Express framework (also many other frameworks)
		- Node.js global object and some packages (as from Node.js Essential Training)
	- Express is framework to generate server-side code for app
		- creating endpoints for app
		- creating server
		- routing knowledge

-- 1 First Steps --

-- 1-2 What is Express.js? --

	- minimal, flexible node.js app framework
	- 1 of the more popular framework for node.js
		- build websites / web apps / APIs using JS
		- handle / simplify responses from API requests
		- supports templating engine to simplify HTML generation
			- Templating Engine: To create HTML templates with minimal code
			- feed variables into templates eg: `This is a JS template string ${var_name}`;
			
	Client (front-end) -> Node HTTP Server -> Express.js -> MiddleWare : All are requests
	Middleware -> Node HTTP Server -> Client : All are responses
	

-- 1-3 Express Application Generator --

	- package that quickly inits skeleton project
	- new technique: using npx, so dont have to install redundant package that runs only at the start of every project
	
		type express -h to find out the different flags available when initing new project
		
		Type of template engine support:
			--ejs
			--pug
			--hbs (handlebars engine support)
			--hogan (hogan.js engine support)
			--view (view <engine> support)
			--no-view (static html instead of view engine) etc.
	
		1) Creating empty directory for project
		2) npm install express-generator
		3) express --git --hbs testapp (add .gitignore file + use handlebars template engine)
			- creates a new expres project known as testapp
		4) cd to testapp and type npm install (to install dependencies)
		5) set DEBUG=testapp:* & npm start (to start server)
		
	
	Some common files / folders of project:
		- "node_modules" directory:
			- generated after npm install
			- to store the packages (dependencies)
			
		- "public" directory: 
			- images dir
			- javascripts dir
			- stylesheets dir
				- styles.css (some basic css for default page)
		
		- "routes" directory: (default routes set-up for running of server)
			- index.js
			- users.js
		
		- "views" directory:
			- contain HandleBars file (template engine)
			- can pass variables into template engines to generate view
			- look into these template engine in separate course
	
		- app.js file (many default boilerplate js created for quick app init)
		- .gitignore file
		- package.json file (for managing dependencies / other info)
		

-- 2 Express Basics --

-- 2-1 Getting Started: Server & Project Setup --

	Steps:
	
		1) Create project directory (eg. express-essentials)
		2) navigate to project dir in terminal prompt (vscode)
		3) npm init (to create package.json file)
			- entry point: index.js
		4) npm install express nodemon
			- helps restart server every time there is new changes
		5) npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/node
			- babel is a compiler for compiling ES6 JS
			- babel is dev dependency (--save-dev) (only use in dev, not in prod)
		6) create .babelrc file (config file for babel)
			- to indicate presets that have been installed
			{
			"presets": [
				"@babel/preset-env"
				]
			}
		7) Check package.json to ensure all dependencies downloaded earlier present
			- under "name", add "type": "module"
				- to be able to use modules introduced in ES6
				- modules will be imported/exported inside index.js file
					- instead of using require() fn used in previous version of JS
					- some projects / documentation may still reference old JS 
		8) add script
			- "start": "nodemon --experimental-json-modules --exec babel-node index.js"
				- nodemon: to use nodemon package
				- --experiment-json-modules: to load json files using ES6 syntax
				- --exec babel-node index.js: run server using babel, start app from index.js file
				
		9) create index.js file (entry point for app)
			- entrypoint file can be named with other names
				- app.js
			- ensure package.json file, "main" : "app.js" 
				- main is the entry point for project
			- ensure command "--exec babel-node app.js" instead
		
		10) Inside index.js file:
		
				import express from "express";
				
				const app = express();
				const PORT = 3000; // not necessary but good to follow
				
				app.listen(PORT, ()=>{
					console.log(`The server is running on port ${PORT}`)
				});
				
				// app.listen(port_number, callback);

-- 2-2 Adding data (json) to Project --

	- When developing API
		- want to test how data is displayed
		- want to use mock data
			- https://www.mockaroo.com
			- save mock.json in project directory
			
		inside index.js file:
		
		import data from './data/mock.json' assert {type: "json"};
		
		app.listen(PORT, ()=>{
			console.log(`The server is running on port ${PORT}`);
			console.log(data);
				});
		
		Import assertion:
			- introduced in ES12 (2021)
			- specify metadata about imported data/modules
			
			eg:
			import defaultExport from 'module' assert { assertion };
			import * as namedExports from 'module' assert { assertion };
			import { namedExport } from 'module' assert { assertion };
			
			import { foo } from './module.js' assert {
			  type: 'json',
			  integrity: 'sha384-ABC123'
			};
	
	Server side vs client side code
		- Browser is tied to client side code
		- Code written in index.js is server side code
			- thus, any console.log will not show in the browser
		- want to create a bridge between server and client side code
		
		HTTP methods
			- GET: used to retrieve data
			- POST
			- PUT
			- DELETE

-- 2-3 HTTP methods & routes --

	- Route:
		- How application responds to client request to a particular endpoint
		- Consist of a path & a HTTP request
	
	- Endpoint:
		- 1 end of a communication channel
		- For APIs, endpoint can include a URL of a server / service
	
	- As user on web, constantly interacting with routes
		- when visiting URL, it is a route that has been coded to serve specific info
			- served info based on page & associated HTTP methods
	
	- HTTP methods:
		- actions taken on specific resource
		- GET: Retrieves data from server
			- retrieve data to display / render page
		- PUT: Updates existing resource
		- POST: Sends data to server, creating new resource
		- DELETE: Delete existing resource
	
	- HTTP messages:
		1) Requests: Sent by client to trigger action on server
		2) Responses: Answers from Server
	
	Constructing Route:
		- each HTTP method takes in 2 argument (path, handler_fn)
			- handler fn: fn to execute once path is found
			
	app.get('/', (request, response) => {
		response.send("This is a GET request at /");
	});
	
	app.post('/create', (request, response) => {
		response.send("This is a POST request at /create");
	});
	
	app.put('/edit', (request, response) => {
		response.send("This is a PUT request at /edit");
	});
	
	app.delete('/delete', (request, response) => {
		response.send("This is a DELETE request at /delete");
	});
	
		- '/': represents the root folder
		- send(): send message to route
		
-- 2-4 Postman Tool --

	- for GET methods, easy to test by referring to client side browser
	- for POST | PUT | DELETE, not as straightforward
		- can use Postman tool to test endpoints
		
	type localhost:3000/create in Postman URL
		- change dropdown type to "POST"
		- click send, should receive body showing response.send() msg
		
	- try the same for:
		/edit - PUT
		/delete - DELETE
		

-- 2-5 GET data, creating basic data endpoint
	- take mock data & serve to client via a GET request to own server
		- commonly done when building endpoints with express
	- sometimes, may be querying data from databases as well
	
	eg.
	
	app.get("/", (req, res) => {
		// first step is usually GET data from database + error handling
		res.json(data); // serve data in json format upon request
	});
	
-- 2-6 Serving static files with Express -- 
	- Aside from querying & fetching data from APIs,
	- Can also serve static files
	
	Static files: Files that does not change
		- photos
		- pdf
		- document files
		- HTML / CSS files
		
	Steps:
		1) Create a folder called "public"
		2) Create a folder called "images", within public folder
		3) app.use(express.static("./public/images"));
			- can serve any static images in this public folder
			- built-in middleware method (express.static)
		4) Paste img in images folder and name it as test1.jpg
		5) open localhost:3000/test1.jpg
		
	Alternatively:
		1) Create "images" folder in project root directory
		2) Place image named test1.jpg within images folder
		3) app.use("/images", express.static("images"));
			- first argument is route 
				- serve images stored at "/images"
		4) Go to browser & type:
			localhost:3000/images/test1.jpg
			
-- 3 Express Routing Fundamentals --

-- 3-1 Routing Parameters --

	Route:
		- How application responds to client request to particular endpoint
		- Postman tool can be used to access a variety of different routes
			- Routes = path + HTTP method
			eg:
			
			app.get("/animals", (req, res) => {
				res.json(data);
			})
			
			Path = "/animals". Can be "/images","/payments" etc.
			HTTP method: GET
		
	4 General Route Methods
		- POST: Create
		- GET: Read
		- PUT: Update
		- DELETE: Delete
		
	Route Parameters
		- Segments of URL used to capture values specified at positions within URL
		- if want to access values passed as parameters:
			- use req.params
			eg:
				console.log(req.params.student_id)
				
		- Any route parameters will be transmitted as string
			- if want to use as number, need to convert using JS string methods
		eg:
		
		app.get("/users/:userId/books/:bookId", (req, res) => {
			res.send(req.params);
		})
		
		- userId & bookId are route parameters
		
		Route Path: "/users/:userId/books/:bookId"
		Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
		req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
		
	
	-- Setting up Route Parameters in Express --
	
		app.get("/class/:student_id", (req, res) => {
			console.log(req.params); // console log is server side code, show in terminal
		})
		
		at url:
			localhost:3000/class/10
			
		outcome:
			- terminal shows {id : '10'}
			- browser doesn't change, no data passed to client side
			
		app.get("/class/:student_id", (req, res) => { // see above for what data is imported from)
		
			const studentId = Number(req.params.student_id);
			const student = data.filter( (item) => 
				studentId === item.id
			);
			res.send(student);
			
		})

-- 3-2 Route handlers --
	- blocks of code that handle logic for routes
	- can be a function, array of functions or both
	- want route handlers (functions) to be simple and straightforward as possible
	- possible to have multiple callbacks to handle different logic
		- using next()
			- not specific to node.js or express.js
			- invokes the next middleware fn in app
			- 3rd argument beside req, res, next.
				- named as next by convention
				
	eg.
	
	app.get('/next', (request, response, next) => {
		console.log("Response will be sent by next function");
		next();
	}, (req, res) => {
		res.send("This is the response from 2nd callback");
	}
	);
	
-- 3-3 Common Response methods for Express Routing --

	- When creating routes, various methods exist to handle response
	- Response methods provide feedback to client
	- Response methods work on the response object, transmitting info to client
	- if method not used correctly, the info will not be transmitted from server to client
	
	* Express Documentation have full list of response methods that can be incorporated
	
		res.json() : Sends a JSON response
		res.send() : Sends the HTTP Response
		res.download() : Transfers file as attachment
			- depending on browser, may have prompt to download or auto download
		res.redirect("https://www.google.com") : Redirect user to different URL
			- can be local to another page
			- can be other website completely
			

-- 3-4 Route Chaining in Express --
	- when creating routes in express
	- may have several routes of same path but different methods (related)
		- if unrelated, might want to come out with different path name
	- start with app.route(path).get(callback).post(callback).put(callback)
	
	eg.
	
	app
	.route("/class")
	.get((req, res) => {
		res.send("Retrieve class info");
	})
	.post((req, res) => {
		res.send("Create class info");
	})
	.put((req, res) => {
		res.send("Update class info");
	})
	 
	 
	app.get("/class", (req, res) => {
		res.send("Retrieve class info");
	});
	
	app.post("/class", (req, res) => {
		res.send("Create class info");
	});
	
	app.put("/class", (req, res) => {
		res.send("Update class info");
	});
	
-- 4 Express Middleware --

-- 4-1 What is middleware --

	- middleware functions:
		- functions that have access to request (req) object, response (res) object and next() function.
	
	- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
		- execute any code
		- make changes to request and response objects
		- end request-response cycle
		- call next middleware in stack
	
	- middleware can come in many forms
		- some are built-in Express
		- some handle errors
		- some are 3rd party middleware
	
-- 4-2 Express Built-in middleware --
	- 3 built-in middleware
		1) express.static
			- serves static assets (files / images)
		2) express.json
			- parses incoming requests with JSON payloads (using body parser)
				- Body parser is node.js parsing middleware
				
			eg.
			{
				"name": "Jamie Pittman",
				"title": "instructor",
				"age": 37
			}
			
		3) express.urlencoded
			- parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (using body parser)
			
			eg.
			
			name=Jamie+Pittman&title=instructor&age=37
			
	eg.
	in index.js:
	
		app.use(express.json());
		app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))
			- extended: true argument provides more JSON-like experience
		
		app.post("/item", (req, res) => {
			console.log(req.body); // log on server side terminal
			res.send(req.body); // show on client side browser
		})
		
	in Postman (JSON):
		1) Select POST & type localhost:3000/item
		2) Go to Headers tab and add:
			Under Key tab: Content-Type
			Under Value tab: application/json
		3) Go to Body tab & select raw
		4) Type in JSON eg
			{
				"item": "rollerblades"
			}
		5) Send the request
	
	in Postman (urlencoded)
	
		1) Select POST & type localhost:3000/item
		2) Go to Headers tab and add:
			Under Key tab: Content-Type
			Under Value tab: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		3) Go to Body tab & select x-www-form-urlencoded
		4) Type in:
			Key tab: item
			value tab: rollerblades
		5) Send the request

-- 4-3 Handling errors --

	eg.
	app.route("/class").get((req, res) => {
		// res.send("Retrieve class info");
		throw new Error();
	})
	
	app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
		console.log(error.stack); // stack trace
		res.status(500).send("Something is broken!");
	})
	
-- 4-4 3rd Party middleware --
	- A lot of middleware packages available
	- may not be maintained & possibly have security issues
	- Express documentation have list of 3rd party middleware
	
-- 5 Taking Express 1 step further -- 

-- 5-1 Debugging Express Application --
	- Debug mode:
		- see all internal logs in Express
		- Express uses debug module internally
			- log info about:
				- route matches
				- middleware functions in use
				- app mode
				- flow of request-response cycle
	
	- command: set DEBUG=express:* & node --experimental-json-modules index.js
	
	- can add in package.json
		"debug": "set DEBUG=express:* & nodemon --experimental-json-modules index.js"
		
	- type: npm run debug (must include run if custom key value, in this case "debug")
	
	
-- 5-2 Using Express with Database --
	- can use express to connect to database to read / write data more robustly
	- mainly using HTTP methods
	- refer to Express with Database for more info
	
-- 5-3 Security Concerns & best practices --
	- Refer to linkedin-learning course for more info
	
	1) Keep most up to date version of Express
		- Older version susceptible to vulnerabilities
		
	2) Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption
		- keep communication over web as secure as possible
		
	3) Use "Helmet" module
		- setting HTTP headers appropriately & securely
		- A collection of middleware functions that set security related HTTP response headers
		
	4) Use cookies securely
		- cookies: how web browsers store & track data about user session
		
	5) Block authorization attempts to prevent brute force attacks
		- rate-limiter-flexible package
	
	6) Ensure dependencies are secure
		- using "npm audit" in terminal
